 Fluentzy: The Fluency Development Course by Prof. Kev Nair.
 ` Prof. Kev Nair is a well-known authority and is considered “The Father of Fluency Development”. It is a set of 20 books. It doesn’t teach grammar. It is for people who already know English quite well and want to speak fluently.`

I’ll just give some highlights from this course.
1. Foreign speakers learn English the wrong way. We are taught to write English rather than to speak first.
2. There’s a lot of differences between written and spoken English.
3. The right way to learn to speak is in word-groups instead of individual words.
4. The way English is spoken is completely different from the way our languages are spoken.
5. Fluency is achieved only when our ears and tongue are trained in English. We may know English but the tongue has to be taught in English ways. And ears have to stop being hesitant to English sounds.
6. Fluency is achieved only through self-study, without any instructor, without any recordings. Any external means is a hurdle.
7. We should get exposed to spoken English a lot. We should read novels written in loose, conversational style. Newspaper, non-fiction books, magazines, and like should be avoided as they’re written for different purpose and aren’t suitable from fluency perspective.
8. We should avoid bilingual dictionaries and learn to think in English. We should buy at least one Advanced English dictionary and look up words for even simple words. Not any word, but fluency oriented words.
