the philosopher Frédéric Gros calls Thoreau’s “new economics,” a theory that builds on the following axiom, which Thoreau establishes early in Walden: “The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.”

triết gia Frédéric Gros gọi Thoreau là “kinh tế học mới”, một lý thuyết được xây dựng dựa trên tiên đề sau đây, mà Thoreau đã thiết lập sớm ở Walden: “Cái giá phải trả của một thứ là số tiền mà tôi sẽ gọi là cuộc sống cần phải đổi lấy nó , ngay lập tức hoặc về lâu dài.”

This new economics offers a radical rethinking of the consumerist culture that began to emerge in Thoreau’s time. Standard economic theory focuses on monetary outcomes. If working one acre of land as a farmer earns you $1 a year in profit, and working sixty acres earns you $60, then you should, if it’s at all possible, work the sixty acres—it produces strictly more money.

Thoreau’s new economics considers such math woefully incomplete, as it leaves out the cost in life required to achieve that extra $59 in monetary profit. As he notes in Walden, working a large farm, as many of his Concord neighbors did, required large, stressful mortgages, the need to maintain numerous pieces of equipment, and endless, demanding labor.
